### Changed

- Agent WebSocket connections (`/api/agent/ws`) remain public and use existing node token authentication.
- Default authentication is disabled (`security.admin.enabled: false`) to preserve existing deployment behavior.
- Session storage is in-memory; Server restart requires re-login.
- Alert engine runs in background goroutine, checks all enabled rules every 30 seconds by default.
- Alert state is memory-only; service restart loses tracking state but preserves history records.
- Changed the add-host flow to focus on generated curl/PowerShell install commands for the single-host dialog.
- Changed the Dashboard navigation and branding with the soft-tech logo, simplified main nav labels, and hidden global history/log entries while preserving their routes.
- Changed Kubernetes filters to use namespace dropdown selection and resource search patterns that keep namespace filtering separate from name/status searching.
- Changed Kubernetes row actions to use softer body-portaled "more" menus so table actions remain usable near scroll boundaries.
- Changed Kubernetes table density so deeper CPU/memory/container details live in drawers or expanded rows instead of crowding the main tables.
- Changed Kubernetes YAML display/editing to remove noisy managed-fields output from normal viewing and require dry-run before saving edits.
- Changed release packaging to include the `VERSION` file and documented direct GitHub Release package downloads.
- Reworked `README.md` and `README.en.md` as visual product introductions with release-package deployment first, current screenshots, and detailed setup moved to docs pages.
- Updated screenshot assets to match the current Dashboard, host, Kubernetes, create-resource, and alert interfaces.

### Fixed

- Fixed Kubernetes cluster detail navigation, empty/null cluster response handling, and connection timeout behavior.
- Fixed Overview "添加服务器" quick action so it opens the existing add-host dialog instead of doing nothing/use a browser alert.
- Fixed long Kubernetes status badges overflowing table and drawer layouts.
- Fixed alert history rule names so renamed rules are reflected when history is listed.
- Fixed disabled alert rules so currently active alerts are resolved instead of remaining active indefinitely.
- Fixed resolved alert cleanup so active alerts cannot be deleted before being resolved.

### Security

- Password comparison uses constant-time `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` to prevent timing attacks.
- Passwords are stored in plaintext in configuration files (self-use scope, not hashed).
- Empty passwords are rejected when authentication is enabled.
- Session TTL defaults to 24 hours; expired sessions are automatically pruned.
- Alert rules API endpoints are protected by authentication middleware when auth is enabled.

## v0.0.4 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added a node-level Agent 管理 tab for checking Agent status, recent Agent logs, and sending Agent restart requests.
- Added Agent management request/response messages across protocol, Agent WebSocket handling, Server agent hub forwarding, and node API routes.
- Added local Agent management handlers for runtime, Docker availability, restart acceptance, and bounded recent log reads.

### Fixed

- Fixed Agent 管理 UI state handling so stale status/log data is cleared when switching nodes or when a node becomes offline.
- Fixed API error handling so JSON `error` messages from Agent management endpoints are shown instead of generic HTTP failures.
- Fixed Docker capability reporting to reflect actual collector availability and errors instead of only the configured Docker monitoring flag.

## v0.0.3 - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Added real Agent uptime, disk read speed, and disk write speed collection across Agent, protocol, Server persistence, API responses, and Dashboard charts.
- Added node detail display for derived boot time and formatted runtime based on reported uptime.
- Added disk I/O chart summaries for read/write throughput.

### Changed

- Refined the Dashboard layout with smoother sidebar collapse/expand animation and a cleaner content header.
- Moved the sidebar collapse control to the outside edge of the sidebar so the collapsed sidebar keeps the logo at the top.
- Simplified Agent installation for self-use root deployments: Linux SSH and manual install now default to root ops mode with terminal access and Docker monitoring enabled.
- Removed Agent install option controls for terminal, Docker monitoring, and run mode from both SSH automatic install and manual install flows.
- Updated manual install copy to use platform-neutral wording where Linux and Windows commands share the same flow.

### Fixed

- Fixed disk I/O display for legacy or missing metrics so the Dashboard shows placeholders instead of `NaN undefined/s`.
- Fixed boot time and runtime display when metric history rows are missing new uptime fields.
- Fixed manual install command generation so Linux install strategy options are owned by the Server instead of frontend query parameters.

## v0.0.2 - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added the first project changelog.
- Added Docker deployment support with a root `Dockerfile`, default SQLite `docker-compose.yml`, optional MySQL `docker-compose.mysql.yml`, and Docker-specific server configs under `docker/`.
- Added optional MySQL storage support alongside the default SQLite storage mode.
- Added database dialect handling for SQLite/MySQL migrations and upsert SQL.
- Added system settings for metrics retention, with runtime updates persisted in the database.
- Added metrics history views with selectable ranges for CPU, memory, disk, network, and load data.
- Added in-panel node record removal confirmation dialog instead of the browser-native confirm dialog.
- Added README architecture SVG at `assets/mizupanel-architecture.svg`.
- Added README screenshot gallery with Dashboard, metrics history, system settings, add-host, and Web terminal screenshots under `assets/screenshots/`.
- Added Linux root-only SSH Agent install jobs with one-time password/private-key credentials and Server-Sent Events progress.
- Added Linux root-only SSH Agent uninstall jobs from node details, including optional panel record removal and progress events.
- Added SSH automatic install controls for terminal access, Docker monitoring, and Agent run mode in the add-host dialog.
- Added Chinese default README with English switch link and a separate `README.en.md`.

### Changed

- Kept SQLite as the default storage backend for simple self-hosted deployments.
- Updated server configuration to support structured storage settings for SQLite and MySQL.
- Updated metric retention validation to use supported values: `6h`, `24h`, `3d`, and `7d`.
- Updated Docker Compose defaults to bind the panel to `127.0.0.1` unless `MIZUPANEL_BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0` is explicitly set.
- Reorganized README content to prioritize core features, Docker quick start, architecture, release package deployment, and Agent setup.
- Condensed Agent install commands into collapsible README sections.
- Changed Linux manual Agent install/uninstall commands to root-only execution instead of `sudo` wrappers.
- Changed SSH install fallback identity handling to use the remote hostname when no node ID is provided.
- Reworked token documentation into a table and registration flow.

### Fixed

- Fixed Vite proxy behavior so same-origin protected API operations such as deleting node records work through the dev server.
- Fixed Vite dev proxy WebSocket forwarding so browser terminal connections under `/api` work through the frontend dev server.
- Fixed metrics API behavior for missing nodes by returning `404` instead of empty history data.
- Fixed history range selection so ranges beyond the configured retention are disabled and rejected.
- Fixed MySQL migration compatibility for existing schemas by using MySQL-compatible column definitions.
- Fixed SSH automatic install option changes so they no longer create unused manual install tokens while the SSH tab is active.
- Fixed the add-host dialog so closing it clears one-time SSH credential fields and install progress state.

### Security

- Avoided exposing database passwords through browser APIs or logs.
- Changed MySQL Docker credentials to required environment variables instead of hardcoded deployment passwords.
- Preserved Agent's active-connection model so target hosts do not expose Agent ports.
- Changed SSH install/uninstall remote scripts to use unique `mktemp` paths instead of predictable `/tmp` script names.
